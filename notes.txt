- Find Covariance of columns to see how changes correlate
- apply principal component analysis to reduce number of features


Data Prep:
    - Needed to remove unnecessary information, such as Serial Number and Symbol
    - Some entries had a volume of 0 which doesn't make sense, so we had to remove them
    - Calculate an average from High Low and Close to create a pivot point
    - This gives us potential support and resistance levels
    - Calculationg mean is feature extraction because we're taking values from multiple columns and focusing it onto a singular point
